I. Introdution

  There are lots of things to vote for and lots of ways to count the votes

  This is not about the Electoral College, where Hillary Clinton got at
  least 600,000 more votes than Donald Trump, yet still did not win the
  election.

A. Things to vote for

  1. People:

     a. Single seat: President, Senator, Member of House of Representatives

     b. Multiple seat: Board of Supervisors, City Council

  2. Things

     a. Oscars

     b. Grammys

     c. Newbery and Caldecott Medal

     d. Customer Satisfaction Surveys

B. Ways to count the votes

  There are at least 12 distinctly different ways of counting votes,
  with numerous variations!  Which one is best?

  To make things even more confusing there are no commonly agreed upon
  names for all the different systems.

  Well, remember, we're trying to build a "more" perfect union, but
  there is no perfect system.  Every system has its flaws.

  There are three broad classes of systems

  1. Proportional Representation Systems

  multi-member bodies

  2. Mixed Member Systems

  multi-member bodies

  3. Plurality/Majoritarian systems

  single-seat

II. Focus on Plurality/Majoritarian

  1. First Past the Post

     Candidate who receives more votes than any other candidate wins

  2. Two-round system

     Like first past the post, but if no candidate has an absolute
     majority (> 50% of the votes) a second round is triggered using the
     top two vote getters as candidates.  

  3. Instant Runoff

     Rank your candidates in decreasing order of desirability

  4. Score voting

     a. score the each candidate on a scale

        1 - 10

        0 - 5 stars

     b. approval voting: each candidate gets zero or one vote

III. Example: Vote for your favorite Pokemon two ways

  1. Using first past the post

  2. Using Instant Runoff Voting
